Directions:
Login with your username and password.  For testing purposes username is test and password is test.  This takes you to the main appointments page.  This lists all the appointments
in the database.  You have the option from here to add, update or delete appointments.  In the top left corner is the customers button and if you click on that you can see a 
list of all customers.  This page also has buttons to add, update or delete customers.  Once you save an appointment or a customer either by adding or updating the new object 
will appear on the corresponding list of either the appointments page or customers page. 

Additional Report:
For the additional report I have counted the number of customers per country.  This section of the reports page will show how many customers are in the US, Canada and the UK respectivly.
